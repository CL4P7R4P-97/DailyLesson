**Highlights & Notes**

> in the long run, external events have very little impact upon
your level of happiness.

> Feelings manifest
as physical sensations in your body, not as an idea in your mind.

> While you are fortunate to have such an effective survival
mechanism, it is also your responsibility to separate real threats from
imaginary ones.

> You don’t ‘feel like’ this book
could be useful, you ‘think’ this book could be useful, and that generates an
emotion which makes you ‘feel’ excited about reading it.

> While in the past, dopamine was linked to our survival instinct,
The release of dopamine can now be generated artificially. A great example
of this effect is social media, which uses psychology to suck as much time
as possible out of your life.

> INTRODUCTION

> It
likely interprets the negative review as a threat to her ego which triggers an
emotional reaction.

> your brain still
gives significantly more weight to negative events than to positive ones.

> If you listen to your
mind, you may even create a whole drama around it. You may believe you
aren’t worthy of love and dwell on a rejection for days or weeks. Worse
still, you may become depressed as a result of this rejection.

> To overcome this bias
towards negativity, you must reprogram your mind. One of a human being’s
greatest powers is our ability to use our thoughts to shape our reality and
interpret events in a more empowering way.

> Your attitude towards life influences your happiness, not what happens
to you.

> your brain is still
programmed to perceive rejection as a threat to your survival.

> To better control your emotions, it is important to
shed the light on your addictions as they can rob you of your happiness.

> If you don’t, you’ll experience unnecessary pain and worry
that will negatively impact the quality of your life.

> Why is it important to talk about emotions?

> How you feel determines the quality of your life. Your emotions can make
your life miserable or truly magical.

> What you’ll learn in this book

> More specifically, this book will help you:
Understand what emotions are and how they impact your life
Identify negative emotions that control your life and learn to
overcome them
Change your story to take better control over your life and create a
more compelling future, and
Reprogram your mind to experience more positive emotions.

> PART I

> WHAT EMOTIONS ARE

> Fear of rejection is one example of a bias toward negativity. In the past,
being rejected from your tribe would reduce your chances of survival
significantly. Therefore, you learned to look for any sign of rejection, and
this became hardwired in your brain.

> The fear of rejection can also lead you to over-dramatize events.

> Why your brain’s job isn’t to make you happy

> Your brain’s primary job is not to make you happy, but to ensure your
survival. Thus, if you want to be happy, you must take control of your
emotions rather than hoping you’ll be happy because it’s your natural state.

> How dopamine can mess with your happiness

> Dopamine is a neurotransmitter which, among other functions, plays a
major role in rewarding certain behaviors. When dopamine is released into
specific areas of your brain—the pleasure centers—you get a high. This is
what happens during exercise, when you gamble, have sex, or eat great
food

> One of the roles of dopamine is to ensure you look for food so you don't die
of starvation, and you search for a mate so you can reproduce. Without
dopamine, our species would likely be extinct by now.

> We’ve become addicted to dopamine largely because of marketers who
have found effective ways to exploit our brains. We receive multiple shots
of dopamine throughout the day and we love it. But is that the same thing as
happiness?

> Worse than that, dopamine can create real addictions with severe
consequences on our health.

> To take control of your emotions, it is essential you understand the role
dopamine plays and how it affects your happiness.

> The ‘one day I will’ myth

> Do you believe that one day you will achieve your dream and finally be
happy? This is unlikely to happen. You may (and I hope you will) achieve
your dream, but you won’t live ‘happily ever after.’ This is just another
trick your mind plays on you.

> Your mind quickly acclimates to new situations, which is probably the
result of evolution and our need to adapt continually in order to survive and
reproduce. This is also probably why the new car or house you want will
only make you happy for a while. Once the initial excitement wears off,
you’ll move on to crave the next exciting thing. This phenomenon is known
as ‘hedonic adaptation.’

> Perhaps you believe that you’ll be happy once you’ve ‘made it.’ But, as the
above study on happiness shows, this is simply not true. No matter what
happens to you, you’ll revert back to your predetermined level of happiness
once you’ve adapted to the new event. This is how your mind works.

> fifty percent of our happiness is determined by genetics, forty percent by
internal factors, and only ten percent by external factors.

> At times, you’ll feel disappointed, betrayed, insecure, resentful
or ashamed. You’ll doubt yourself and doubt your ability to be the person
you want to be. But that’s okay because emotions come, but, more
importantly, they go.

> When you strongly associate with your physical appearance, you
tend to identify more easily with physical and emotional pain. Believe it or
not, you can observe your body without ‘identifying with’ it.

> The way it
does that is through identification with things, people, or beliefs and ideas.

> We often say of someone he has a
“big ego” referring to the ego as something close to pride. While pride is
certainly a manifestation of ego, that’s only one part of it. You may show no
pride and appear humble while still being controlled by your ego.

> This is based on the false belief their
children are their ‘possessions.’ As a result, they try to control their
childrens’ lives and ‘use’ them to live the life they wanted to live when they
were younger—this is called living vicariously through your children.

> It uses things to create a story you can identify
with. It doesn’t mean things are wrong per se. It’s a negative issue only
when you become overly attached to things, believing they can fulfill you—
which they can’t

> WHAT IS THE EGO

> The ego refers to the self-identity you’ve constructed throughout your life.
How was this identity created? Put simply, the ego was created through
your thoughts and, as a mind-created identity, has no concrete reality.

> Events that happen to you bear no meaning in themselves. You give them
meaning only through your interpretation of those events.

> This attachment has consequences.

> attachment creates beliefs, and these beliefs lead you to experience certain
emotions

> Note that the ego is neither good nor bad, it’s just a result of a lack of self-
awareness. It fades away as you become aware of it, since ego and
awareness cannot coexist.

> Your ego’s need for an identity

> Your ego is a selfish entity, only concerned about its own survival.

> Physical items

> The ego likes to identify with physical things.

> Marketers perfectly understand people’s need to identify with things. They
know people don’t just buy a product, they also buy the emotions or story
attached to the product. Often, you buy certain clothes or a particular car
because you want to tell a story about yourself. For instance, you may want
to enhance your status, look cool or express your unique personality, and
choose the products most closely associated with these ideals.

> Your body

> Friends/acquaintances

> The ego also derives its sense of identity from your relationships with
others. The ego is only interested in what it can get from others. In other
words, the ego thrives on the way it can use people to strengthen its
identity.
If you are honest with yourself, you’ll realize most of the things you do are
attempts to obtain the approval of others. You want your parents to be proud
of you, your boss to respect you, and your wife to love you.
Now, let’s see in more detail how the ego works in the following cases:

> Parent/child relationships

> Couples

> Loneliness is not cured by human company. Loneliness is cured
by contact with reality, by understanding that we don’t need
people.

> Once you realize you don’t actually need anyone, you can start enjoying
people’s company. You can see them as they really are rather, than trying to
get something from them.

> Your beliefs

> Religion is a perfect illustration of the dangers of excessive attachment to
beliefs. The ego will use any belief to strengthen its identity, whether these
beliefs are religious, political, or metaphysical.

> Other objects of identification

> Your body
Your name
Your gender
Your nationality
Your culture
Your family/friends
Your beliefs (political beliefs, religious, etc.)
Your personal story (your interpretation of the past, your
expectations regarding the future)
Your problems (illnesses, financial situation, victim mindset, etc.)
Your age
Your job
Your social status
Your role (as employee, homemaker, parental status, employment
status, etc.)
Material items (your house, car, clothes, phone, etc.)
Your desires

> The ego’s main characteristics

> The ego tends to equate ‘having’ with ‘being,’ which is why the
ego likes to identify with objects.
The ego lives through comparison. Your ego likes to compare itself
with other egos.
The ego is never satisfied. Your ego always wants more. More
fame, more stuff, more recognition, and so on.
The ego’s sense of self-worth often depends on the worth you have
in the eyes of others. Your ego needs the approval of other people
to feel valued.

> The ego’s need to feel superior

> THE NATURE OF EMOTIONS

> You must allow yourself to feel sad without adding
commentaries such as, “I shouldn’t be sad,” or “What’s wrong with me?”
Instead, you must allow reality to just be.

> No matter how mentally tough you are, you’ll still experience sadness, grief
or depression in your life—hopefully not at the same time, and not
continually.

> Your negative emotions are not bad or useless.

> You may blame yourself for experiencing negative emotions or, perhaps,
you see yourself as mentally weak. You may even believe something is
wrong with you. However, despite what your inner voice may say, your
emotions aren’t bad. Emotions are simply emotions. Nothing more.

> Remember this: the way you interpret emotions, as well as the blame game
you engage in, creates suffering, not the emotions themselves.

> The positive role of negative emotions

> Your emotions are not here to make your life harder, but to tell you
something. Without them, you wouldn’t grow.

> Emotions work the same way. They signal you to do something about your
current situation. Perhaps, you need to let go of some people, quit your job,
or remove a disempowering story that creates suffering in your life.
