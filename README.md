Master Your Emotions 


**Highlights & Notes**

> in the long run, external events have very little impact upon
your level of happiness.

> Feelings manifest
as physical sensations in your body, not as an idea in your mind.

> While you are fortunate to have such an effective survival
mechanism, it is also your responsibility to separate real threats from
imaginary ones.

> You don’t ‘feel like’ this book
could be useful, you ‘think’ this book could be useful, and that generates an
emotion which makes you ‘feel’ excited about reading it.

> While in the past, dopamine was linked to our survival instinct,
The release of dopamine can now be generated artificially. A great example
of this effect is social media, which uses psychology to suck as much time
as possible out of your life.

> INTRODUCTION

> It
likely interprets the negative review as a threat to her ego which triggers an
emotional reaction.

> your brain still
gives significantly more weight to negative events than to positive ones.

> If you listen to your
mind, you may even create a whole drama around it. You may believe you
aren’t worthy of love and dwell on a rejection for days or weeks. Worse
still, you may become depressed as a result of this rejection.

> To overcome this bias
towards negativity, you must reprogram your mind. One of a human being’s
greatest powers is our ability to use our thoughts to shape our reality and
interpret events in a more empowering way.

> Your attitude towards life influences your happiness, not what happens
to you.

> your brain is still
programmed to perceive rejection as a threat to your survival.

> To better control your emotions, it is important to
shed the light on your addictions as they can rob you of your happiness.

> If you don’t, you’ll experience unnecessary pain and worry
that will negatively impact the quality of your life.

> Why is it important to talk about emotions?

> How you feel determines the quality of your life. Your emotions can make
your life miserable or truly magical.

> What you’ll learn in this book

> More specifically, this book will help you:
Understand what emotions are and how they impact your life
Identify negative emotions that control your life and learn to
overcome them
Change your story to take better control over your life and create a
more compelling future, and
Reprogram your mind to experience more positive emotions.

> PART I

> WHAT EMOTIONS ARE

> Fear of rejection is one example of a bias toward negativity. In the past,
being rejected from your tribe would reduce your chances of survival
significantly. Therefore, you learned to look for any sign of rejection, and
this became hardwired in your brain.

> The fear of rejection can also lead you to over-dramatize events.

> Why your brain’s job isn’t to make you happy

> Your brain’s primary job is not to make you happy, but to ensure your
survival. Thus, if you want to be happy, you must take control of your
emotions rather than hoping you’ll be happy because it’s your natural state.

> How dopamine can mess with your happiness

> Dopamine is a neurotransmitter which, among other functions, plays a
major role in rewarding certain behaviors. When dopamine is released into
specific areas of your brain—the pleasure centers—you get a high. This is
what happens during exercise, when you gamble, have sex, or eat great
food

> One of the roles of dopamine is to ensure you look for food so you don't die
of starvation, and you search for a mate so you can reproduce. Without
dopamine, our species would likely be extinct by now.

> We’ve become addicted to dopamine largely because of marketers who
have found effective ways to exploit our brains. We receive multiple shots
of dopamine throughout the day and we love it. But is that the same thing as
happiness?

> Worse than that, dopamine can create real addictions with severe
consequences on our health.

> To take control of your emotions, it is essential you understand the role
dopamine plays and how it affects your happiness.

> The ‘one day I will’ myth

> Do you believe that one day you will achieve your dream and finally be
happy? This is unlikely to happen. You may (and I hope you will) achieve
your dream, but you won’t live ‘happily ever after.’ This is just another
trick your mind plays on you.

> Your mind quickly acclimates to new situations, which is probably the
result of evolution and our need to adapt continually in order to survive and
reproduce. This is also probably why the new car or house you want will
only make you happy for a while. Once the initial excitement wears off,
you’ll move on to crave the next exciting thing. This phenomenon is known
as ‘hedonic adaptation.’

> Perhaps you believe that you’ll be happy once you’ve ‘made it.’ But, as the
above study on happiness shows, this is simply not true. No matter what
happens to you, you’ll revert back to your predetermined level of happiness
once you’ve adapted to the new event. This is how your mind works.

> fifty percent of our happiness is determined by genetics, forty percent by
internal factors, and only ten percent by external factors.
